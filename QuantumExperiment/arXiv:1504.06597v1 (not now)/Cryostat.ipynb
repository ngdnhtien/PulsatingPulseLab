    "Unitary errors, namely over/under-rotation, are prohibitively announced in gate-iteratived experiments. In this note, we find a method for distingushing between unitary and non-unitary errors in quantum gates by interleaved randomized benchmarking (IRB). The benchmarking fidelity decays quadratically with the number of interleaved gates for unitary errors, but linearly for non-unitary, allowing us to seperate systematic coherent errors by unitary errors. Also, we'd find that unitary errors is in fact not a limiting factor for gate fidelity, but by amplitude fluctuations. "

If the gate error are non-unitary, they will vary coherently with $n$, leading to a quadratic relationship between $n$ and gate error. To see this, suppose we have a single qubit *unitary error* of the form\n",
